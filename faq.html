					<h4 class="f3 __abcolor">SHIPMENT</h4>
					<p class="__priv"><strong><u>How Can I Be Alerted When Shipment Deliveries Posted?</u></strong></p>
					<p class="__priv">We send out delivery notifications to partners both for forward and reverse logistics via email once a shipment delivery has been created. You can also enable Notification Preferences so you get alerted when a delivery has been created that you might be interested in hauling. These alerts can be based on your current location, your truck and cargo type you haul.</p>

					<p class="__priv"><strong><u>How do I know the item I am delivering is safe to carry?</u></strong></p>
					<p class="__priv">Our terms of service prohibit sending illegal or contraband items being delivered by shippers via our platform. If you suspect, any illicit or prohibited item, please contact support for help via <strong>support@transafty.com</strong></p>
					<p class="__priv"><strong><u>What Kind of Auto Insurance Do I Need?</u></strong></p>
					<p class="__priv">A Transafty partner should have a current comprehensive auto insurance policy. Transafty partners are responsible for all claims and necessary contacts with their insurance carrier in the event of a motor vehicle accident or other liability claim on their vehicle.</p>
					<p class="__priv">While some hauling contract would stipulate that a transporter obtain GIT (Goods in Transit) insurance policy, as a requirement to haul their shipment, we advise shipper to obtain a GIT policy for their shipment. We can help arrange such insurance but shippers responsible for all claims and necessary contacts with their insurer in the event of a liability claim on their shipment.</p>
					<p class="__priv"><strong><u>Can I Ask For More Money On a service?</u></strong></p>
					<p class="__priv">Transafty gives you the liberty to make an offer you are comfortable with, and come to an agreement with the shipper. This means that the payment for a service is based on a satisfactory price between both parties. We know that some partners may sometimes desire a bit more of a payout for a service, but asking for more on a service is discouraged.</p>
					<p class="__priv">Shippers are also given an opportunity (on the app) to add a little extra to a service delivery as a reward if they so choose, but they're not expected to pay anything outside of the amount agreed with a delivery partner.</p>
					<p class="__priv">Delivery partners who regularly follow the standard process are usually chosen over someone who requests a higher payout for the service.</p>
					<p class="__priv">If a Partner repeatedly asks for more money on haulage services, their account will be considered for suspension.</p>
					<p class="__priv">Keep in mind that if a service doesn't seem worth it based on the shipment destinations or price points, you are totally free to pass on it and wait for the next one that fits your requirements. Transafty booking platform is very flexible as partners aren't required to take a certain number or percentage of service deliveries, so feel free to just wait for the right service that fits you.</p>
					<p class="__priv"><strong><u>What Do I Do If a Shipper Is Unresponsive To My Offer Or Comment?</u></strong></p>
					<p class="__priv">If you have put an offer on a haulage service or equipment booking but the shipper is not responding, you are able to cancel your offer within the Transafty app so you can get on with your itinery. We know that your schedule is just as important as the shipper's, so there's no penalty for rescinding your offer on a service before it's been accepted.</p>
					<p class="__priv"><strong><u>What Do I Do If I'm No Longer Able to Deliver a Delivery That I've Been Accepted for?</u></strong></p>

					<p class="__priv">We know the unexpected situations can come up sometimes. If you can't fulfil a service or run into a problem during a shipment delivery, just call support on 08131668024, or click the TransaftyAssist™/ Get Help button in your app and one of our Support Team members will arrange for another partner to complete your delivery. However, do communicate this on time so as to give enough time to arrange a different delivery partner and ensure that our senders do not get disappointed with their delivery requests.</p>

					<p class="__priv"><strong><u>What Do I Do If I Can't Reach the Recipient When I Am at The Delivery Location?</u></strong></p>
					<p class="__priv">If you arrive at the delivery location and you're unable to reach the recipient, you should contact Transafty Support on 08131668024 team to get help.</p>
					<p class="__priv"><strong><u>Can I Deliver Multiple Shipment Deliveries at The Same Time?</u></strong></p>
					<p class="__priv">Yes, it's completely up to you whether you handle a single Delivery or multiple Deliveries at the same time. Before offering to handle multiple shipment deliveries at the same time, be 100% sure that your trucks are available and in good working condition; that you'll be able to meet each delivery deadline, and that you can handle the pick-up and drop-off logistics associated with each Delivery.</p>

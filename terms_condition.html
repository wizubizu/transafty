							<strong>Transafty</strong> shall – 
							<ol type="I">
								<li>issue a Transport Order once the Carrier has confirmed that it will convey an intended consignment in terms of this Agreement pursuant to an enquiry received from <strong>Transafty</strong> in that regard;  </li><br>

								As with the Shipper, a request/order is deemed canceled if the Carrier cancels the order once accepting the request, provided that a Driver may cancel a request within 1 hour of being selected for such request without penalty for such cancellation. A Carrier will be considered a No-Show if he/she fails to arrive at the drop-off/pick-up location more than 3 hours after the agreed time without calling, messaging or otherwise contacting the Shipper through the Application, A Carrier will not be charged a fee if they cancel a request due to a Shipper’s No-Show or if they cannot accept the request due to restrictions in these T&C or other restrictions under applicable law.</li><br>

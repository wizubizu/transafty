					<h3 class="f3 tf-25">Collection and Use of Your Personal Information</h3>
					<p class="__priv">Transafty provides a unique, innovative, community-based online delivery service. A failure by you to provide information requested by us may mean that we are unable to provide some or all of our services to you.<br>

					Transafty collects personal information when you register with Transafty. This may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number, contact details, birth date, gender, credit card and account details, occupation and interests. We might also give you the option of providing a photo or video to be associated with your Transafty user ID. If your personal details change, it is your responsibility to update your Transafty account with those changes, so that we can keep our records complete, accurate and up to date.<br>

					You are not anonymous to us when you log into the Site or post any content (including listings, items to be shipped, offers, comments or feedback) on the Site or any associated forum. To enable us to improve our existing services and to create new service features, Transafty may collect, and share with other users and service providers on Transafty, information about the way you use our services, including (but not limited to) the transactions you enter into on the Site, your feedback rating (including any references requested using our 'Reference' feature), the listings you make, the comments you post, and the transactions you enter into with our valued affiliate service providers.<br>

 

					<strong>When you:</strong><br>

					use the Site to post a listing or item to be shipped, or make an offer, or comment on an offer, or provide feedback on other users; or otherwise communicate in a public forum on the Site, your user ID and all the material that you post is visible to other Transafty users and is also publicly available to other internet users. We strongly encourage you to use caution and discretion when posting. Transafty does not in any way control, and does not accept any responsibility or liability whatsoever for, the disclosure or use of personal information which is voluntarily posted by you in any publicly accessible area of the Site.<br>

					Transafty may also receive and record information from your internet browser and computer, including IP addresses, cookies (see section 2 below), software and hardware attributes and your page requests.<br>

					In addition to data collected from your submissions, we may also collect data on your internet behavior from Facebook, other social media sites, and other services. If you use a location- enabled Transafty service, We may collect and process information about your actual location (for example, GPS signals sent by your mobile device). We may also use a range of different technologies to confirm your location.<br>

					Transafty may use the information collected by it to provide the Transafty Services, including (but not limited to):<br>

					identification and authentication;<br>

					to protect Transafty and the users of the Site;<br>

					to customise the content and any advertising displayed on the Site;<br>

					to provide, maintain, protect and improve our services;<br>

					providing your information to a user with whom you have or had a contract facilitated by Transafty;<br>

					as required by law, order of a court, tribunal or regulator or if Transafty reasonably believes that the use or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary for enforcement related activities;<br>

					to develop new service features;<br>

					to ensure that Transafty receives payment of the fees due to it;<br>

					to contact you (for example, to inform you about upcoming changes or improvements to our services);<br>

					to conduct research;<br>

					to permit content on the Site (such as postings or third party advertisements) to be targeted, on an aggregate basis, to the users for whom it is most likely to be relevant;<br>

					to expand our user base;<br>

					to develop our relationships with affiliate service providers;<br>

					to provide or arrange internal or external verification services obtained by you via the Site; and<br>

					to generate data reports on an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis, for both internal and third party use, but subject to any applicable laws (for example, We may show advertisers or investors trends relating to the general use of Transafty's services).<br>

					Your contact information may also be used for accounting, invoicing and billing purposes, marketing purposes, by third party service providers to Transafty, and to respond to any enquiry you make, in some cases information we collect is transferred overseas. When you contact Transafty, We may keep a record of the communication(s) between you and Transafty to help resolve any issues you might have. If other user(s) of the Site already have your userID (or other information identifying you), and you have chosen to upload a photo or other personal information to your Transafty account, We may show those user(s) that personal information.<br>

					In certain circumstances We will use your email address to administer our User Agreement (for example, We may notify you of a breach, or action a request for a Take Down Notice in response to a claim of copyright infringement).<br>

					If We collect, use or disclose any information from you that is not personal information, but is sensitive information (such as information relating to police checks conducted on users of the Site), then We will seek consent directly from you each time we collect, use or disclose your sensitive information, including for direct marketing purposes. We will not use or disclose your sensitive information for any other purpose unless the purpose is directly related to the primary purpose for which your sensitive information was collected.</p>

					<h3 class="f3 tf-25">Information we collect</h3>
					<p class="__priv">This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect via e-mail, telephone, the website www.Transafty.com (“Site”), mobile applications, electronic devices and other interactive services. In order to help you get the most out of our service, we collect User submitted personally identifiable information (“PII”) when you use the Site. We ask Site users only to submit the minimum amount of information necessary to use our service. Such information may include your name, address, password, zip code, email address, and phone number for communication purposes. Information may be submitted to the Site or via phone or email when communicating with a Transafty representative. For Clients and Couriers, we may collect information related to your documentation of and payment for tutoring sessions, Offline ID Card or Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) and date of birth, for tax purposes or to complete a background check. As detailed in the "Data Transmission and Storage" section below, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption on any page of the Site where we ask you to submit personally identifiable information and encrypt all such information for safe storage in our system.<br>

 

					We also gather non-PII when you use the Site. Such data is compiled in aggregate and includes things like the referring URL and the type of browser you may be using to access the Site. This data is used to better understand and enhance the user experience on the Site. Transafty may publish these statistics or share them with third parties without including PII.<br>

 

					User generated content posted through certain social networking preferences (e.g. pages you "Like" or "Follow") may be viewed by the general public. Accordingly, Transafty cannot ensure the privacy of any PII included in such User generated content.</p>

					<h2 class="f3 tf-25">Data transmission and storage</h2>
					<p class="__priv">Transafty uses industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption when collecting and transmitting your information through the Site and the Transafty network (collectively, the “System.”) Once information has been collected, we encrypt sensitive data in our database for added security. Transafty also uses firewalls and hardware monitoring across our System to protect against unauthorized access. Unfortunately, even with these measures, Transafty cannot guarantee the security of PII. By using the Site, you acknowledge and agree that Transafty makes no such guarantee, and that you use the Site at your own risk.</p>

					<h3 class="f3 tf-25">Financial information</h3>
					<p class="__priv">If you elect to pay for delivery service with a credit or debit card, we do not store your card details including your name, credit card number, and expiration date associated with the account. All financial information is collected and encrypted by the third-party payment processor used on the Site.</p>
					<h3 class="f3 tf-25">Use of cookies</h3>
					<p class="__priv">Transafty uses cookies to help create a better user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a web server and may be stored on your computer’s hard drive. Transafty uses cookies to better customize your experience on the Site based on User attributes like your location and account preferences. No personally identifiable information is stored in our cookies. While you may elect to disable or delete cookies from your browser at any time, please note that this action may limit your use of Transafty services that require cookies. You also can control advertising cookies from Google, by using its Ads Preference Manager. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Site, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.</p>

					<h3 class="f3 tf-25">Online tracking</h3>
					<p class="__priv">Some browsers allow you to indicate that you would not like your online activities tracked, using "Do Not Track" indicators ("DNT Indicators"), however, we are not obligated to respond to these indicators. Presently, we are not set up to respond to DNT Indicators. This means that while the Site may track certain latent information about your online activities, the collected information will be used to improve your use of our Site and in ways consistent with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
					<h3 class="f3 tf-25">Protecting and Maintaining Personal Information</h3>
					<p class="__priv">Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We will take all reasonable steps to protect the information We hold about you from unauthorized access, use and disclosure, however We cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information, or that our systems will be completely free from third party interception or are incorruptible from viruses. You transmit your personal information to us at your own risk.<br>

					You are entirely responsible for maintaining the security of your passwords and/or account information.</p>
					<h3 class="f3 tf-25">Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
					<p class="__priv">Transafty does not disclose or sell your PII without your consent. We may use PII or other personal information you specifically give to us: a) to provide services to you through the System, b) to process transactions and billing, c) for identification and authentication purposes, d) to communicate with you concerning the System, transactions, security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of the System, e) to improve your response to and interaction with the System, f) to do something you have asked us to do, or tell you of services that we think may be of interest to you; and g) for administration of and troubleshooting regarding the System.

We reserve the right to release non-personally identifiable information collected in aggregate, however.</p>

					We are legally permitted or required to deny you access to, and/ or to retain, the information; or you make request(s) that are unreasonably repetitive, require Transafty to make a disproportionate technical effort (for example, to develop an entirely new system), risk the privacy of others, or would be highly impractical to comply with.<br>
